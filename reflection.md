This was a challenging assignment. My initial impression of Java is that I don't like it becuase I feel like I have to think a lot differently than what I'm used to with Python. It was challenging to learn the syntax but also about the types and methods avliable in java. Specifically, using the scanner felt much less intuitive than the input function in python. I also had a challenging time figuring out how to initialize an empty list and how to concatinate and work with strings. It felt very different from Python. In both languges and programming in general developers need ways/methods of getting user input and how that happens changes how easy the data is to work with/acess.

I used the java docs (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html) to figure out how to make a string array, how to use the .split() method, how to use the .add() method, how to use the .length method, and generally the syntax of if statements and for loops. I also referenced the examples/warmup problems for this assignement and the other code we've done in class. 

I talked with the TAs Lan and Ashby and my classmate Liyana and Nina at TA drop in hours on 9/24.

This was a challenging assignment. My initial impression of Java is that I don't like it becuase I have to think a lot differently than what I'm used to with Python. It was challenging to learn the syntax but also about the types and methods avliable in java. Specifically, using the scanner felt much less intuitive than the input function in python. I also had a challenging time figuring out how to initialize an empty list- (string array) and how to concatinate and work with strings. It felt very different from Python. In both languges and programming in general developers need ways/methods of getting user input and how that happens changes how easy the data is to work with/acess. Something that I was able to work with was the general outline/overview of how I was going to accomplish tasks. When I was trying to make the trasncript I was able to conclude that I would need some sort of list to append each line of the conversation to. I felt good about my ability to plan out how to tackle problems even if the syntax and implementation was difficult to work with in Java. My advice would be to start early on this assignment and reference the documentation frequently.
